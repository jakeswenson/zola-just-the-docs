## Color schemes

New

Just the Docs supports two color schemes: light (default), and dark.

To enable a color scheme, set the `color_scheme` parameter in your site's `_config.yml` file:

#### Example

```yaml
# Color scheme currently only supports "dark" or nil (default)
color_scheme: "dark"
```
<button class="btn js-toggle-dark-mode">Preview dark color scheme</button>

<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ "/assets/js/dark-mode-preview.js" | absolute_url }}"></script>

## Specific visual customization

To customize your site’s aesthetic, open `_sass/custom/custom.scss` in your editor to see if there is a variable that you can override. Most styles like fonts, colors, spacing, etc. are derived from these variables. To override a specific variable, uncomment its line and change its value.

For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, open `_sass/custom/custom.css` and find the `$link-color` variable on line `50`. Uncomment it, and change its value to our `$blue-000` variable, or another shade of your choosing.

#### Example

```scss
// ...
//
// $body-text-color: $grey-dk-100;
// $body-heading-color: $grey-dk-300;
$link-color: $blue-000;
//
// ...
```

_Note:_ Editing the variables directly in `_sass/support/variables.scss` is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail.

## Override styles

For styles that aren't defined as a variables, you may want to modify specific CSS classes. 
To add your own CSS overrides at the end of the cascade, edit `_sass/overrides.scss`. 
This will allow for all overrides to be kept in a single file, and for any upstream changes to still be applied.

For example, if you'd like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles.

#### Example

```scss
// Print-only styles.
@media print {
  .side-bar, .page-header { display: none; }
  .main-content { max-width: auto; margin: 1em;}
}
```
